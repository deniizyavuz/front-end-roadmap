# front-end-roadmap,
This project was my first attempt when I started taking front-end training.I tried to make it look like a page on my own school's website.I progressed to my front-end 
training from Frontend Developer Roadmap.At first I wrote using only HTML5 and CSS. Then I added JavaScript and handled some operations, things like the login module. 
The files that use certain functions of JavaScript and that I have sampled are under the js-frontend file. Actually this project is a basic HTML, CSS project with some
JavaScript codes.
